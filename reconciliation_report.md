## Reconciliation Report: Invoice Transactions

**Date:** March 15, 2024

### 1. Introduction

This report presents the findings of a recent reconciliation effort between our internal invoice records and corresponding bank statement data. The primary objective of this exercise was to identify and quantify any discrepancies to ensure accuracy in financial reporting and facilitate timely resolution of unmatched transactions. The reconciliation was performed on a dataset comprising 200 invoice records.

### 2. Overall Reconciliation Rate

Out of the total 200 invoice transactions reviewed, 165 records were successfully reconciled, indicating a high match rate between our internal system and bank records.

*   **Total Transactions Reviewed:** 200
*   **Matched Transactions:** 165
*   **Unmatched Transactions:** 35
*   **Overall Reconciliation Rate:** 82.5%

While the overall reconciliation rate is strong, the remaining 17.5% of transactions represent critical discrepancies that require immediate attention to maintain data integrity and prevent potential financial impact.

### 3. Summary of Issues Found

The 35 unmatched transactions fall into four distinct categories of discrepancies, as summarized in the table below:

| Discrepancy Type        | Number of Occurrences | Total Mismatch Amount (Absolute Value) | Percentage of Unmatched Records |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Amount Mismatch         | 3                     | 3.42                                   | 8.57%                           |
| Duplicate in Bank       | 8                     | 8,865.86                               | 22.86%                          |
| Missing in Bank         | 20                    | 23,905.43                              | 57.14%                          |
| Rounding Difference     | 4                     | 2.30                                   | 11.43%                          |
| **Total Unmatched**     | **35**                | **32,777.01**                          | **100.00%**                     |

The "Missing in Bank" category accounts for the largest number of discrepancies and the highest total mismatch value, indicating a significant area for investigation. "Duplicate in Bank" also represents a substantial financial impact.

### 4. Detailed Findings

#### 4.1. Amount Mismatches

Three invoices exhibited minor amount mismatches, where the recorded system amount differed slightly from the bank-processed amount. These discrepancies could be due to bank charges, partial payments, or data entry errors.

*   **Example 1 (INV0002):** System amount was 1789.75, but the bank recorded 1788.62, resulting in a difference of 1.13.
*   **Example 2 (INV0178):** System amount was 390.27, but the bank recorded 391.43, a difference of -1.16.
*   **Example 3 (INV0181):** System amount was 262.66, but the bank recorded 263.79, a difference of -1.13.

#### 4.2. Duplicate Entries in Bank

Eight invoices were flagged as having duplicate entries in the bank, meaning the bank recorded the transaction twice, leading to an overstatement of the bank balance for these items. These cases resulted in a significant negative mismatch amount, requiring correction.

*   **Example 1 (INV0017):** Invoice amount was 1992.44, but the bank recorded 3984.88 (twice the amount), indicating a duplicate bank entry.
*   **Example 2 (INV0055):** Invoice amount was 1863.27, with the bank showing 3726.54.
*   **Example 3 (INV0132):** Invoice amount was 1947.64, with the bank showing 3895.28.
*   **Example 4 (INV0110):** Invoice amount was 619.67, with the bank showing 1239.34.

#### 4.3. Missing Entries in Bank

The most frequent and financially impactful discrepancy type identified was "Missing in Bank," with 20 invoices having no corresponding record in the bank statement. This could indicate unrecorded transactions, delayed processing, or issues with payment initiation/receipt.

*   **Example 1 (INV0028):** An invoice with a status of "Pending" for 1815.57 had no corresponding bank entry.
*   **Example 2 (INV0034):** A "Cancelled" invoice for 1729.63 was missing from the bank.
*   **Example 3 (INV0093):** A "Paid" invoice for 1885.87 was missing from the bank.
*   **Example 4 (INV0199):** A "Cancelled" invoice for 1885.74 was missing from the bank.

The presence of "Paid" and "Cancelled" invoices missing from the bank requires urgent investigation, as "Paid" implies money should have moved, and "Cancelled" should not have a bank entry unless it was a reversal.

#### 4.4. Rounding Differences

Four invoices showed minor rounding differences, where the discrepancy was typically less than one unit of currency. These are often acceptable within a certain tolerance but should be understood.

*   **Example 1 (INV0050):** System amount was 149.06, bank recorded 148.39, a difference of 0.67.
*   **Example 2 (INV0117):** System amount was 356.26, bank recorded 356.06, a difference of 0.20.

### 5. Recommendations

Based on the reconciliation results, the following actions are recommended to address the identified discrepancies and improve future reconciliation processes:

1.  **Prioritize Investigation of "Missing in Bank" Entries:**
    *   **Urgent Action:** Immediately investigate the 20 invoices flagged as "Missing in Bank." Special attention should be given to invoices with "Paid" status (e.g., INV0093, INV0175, INV0197) to confirm payment status and trace funds.
    *   **Cancelled Invoices:** For "Cancelled" invoices missing from the bank (e.g., INV0034, INV0041, INV0069, INV0199, INV0200), verify that no actual funds were transferred. If they were, assess the process for cancellation and associated bank transactions.
    *   **Pending Invoices:** For "Pending" invoices missing from the bank (e.g., INV0028, INV0113, INV0128, INV0142, INV0171, INV0173, INV0179), determine if the payments are genuinely outstanding or if there was an issue with the expected bank receipt.

2.  **Resolve "Duplicate in Bank" Discrepancies:**
    *   **Investigation:** Investigate the 8 instances of duplicate bank entries (e.g., INV0017, INV0021, INV0055, INV0062, INV0110, INV0132, INV0136, INV0145). This could indicate issues with our payment system double-submitting transactions or the bank processing payments multiple times.
    *   **Action:** Initiate contact with the bank to reverse or correct the duplicate transactions where applicable.

3.  **Analyze "Amount Mismatch" Discrepancies:**
    *   **Review:** Examine the 3 amount mismatches (INV0002, INV0178, INV0181) to determine the cause. If these are consistent bank fees, consider adjusting our internal recording procedures or setting up a separate ledger for bank charges. If they are data entry errors, implement additional review steps.

4.  **Establish Tolerance for "Rounding Differences":**
    *   **Policy Review:** Review the 4 rounding differences (INV0050, INV0117, INV0170, INV0195). Determine if these small variances are acceptable within a defined tolerance level (e.g., +/- $1.00) due to currency conversions or specific calculation methods. If not, investigate the precision settings in our financial systems.

5.  **Process Improvement:**
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a deeper root cause analysis for recurring discrepancy types, especially "Missing in Bank" and "Duplicate in Bank." This may involve reviewing the end-to-end process from invoice creation and payment initiation to bank statement import and reconciliation.
    *   **System Enhancements:** Evaluate whether system configurations, data integration points, or automated reconciliation tools can be enhanced to prevent these types of errors proactively.
    *   **Training:** Provide additional training to personnel involved in invoice processing and payment handling to reinforce best practices and reduce manual errors.

By addressing these recommendations, we can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of our financial reconciliation process, leading to more reliable financial data and better decision-making.
